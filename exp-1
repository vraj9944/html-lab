       <b><u><em><h1>PARAGRAPH</h1></em></u></b> 
        <p>Most paragraphs in an essay have a three-part structure—introduction, body, and conclusion. You can see this
             structure in paragraphs whether they are narrating, describing, comparing, contrasting, or analyzing information. Each part of the paragraph 
             plays an important role in communicating your meaning to your reader.<br>
             <br><b>Introduction:</b></p>
             the first section of a paragraph; should include the topic sentence and any other sentences at the beginning of the paragraph that give background
              information or provide a transition.
            <br>
            <br> <b>Body:</b>follows the introduction; discusses the controlling idea, using facts, arguments, analysis, examples, and other information.
            </p>
            <strong><mark>Conclusion:</mark></strong>
            <p>the final section; summarizes the connections between the information discussed in the body of the paragraph and the paragraph’s controlling idea.<br>               
The following paragraph illustrates this pattern of organization. In this paragraph the topic sentence and concluding sentence <ins>(CAPITALIZED)</ins>both help the reader
 keep the paragraph’s main point in mind.
